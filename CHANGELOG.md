## 88fe215 — Fix multi-tenancy data-visibility/usage-consistency bugs; add relational layer on guardian-db 0.18; add per-node relay + guardian-db anti-entropy

Team Simpfi's `drugs-wtf` project and fleet-wide billing/metrics were reported
missing/inconsistent — `ProjectStore`/`BillingStore` were node-local-only with
no gossip replication. Adds a relational mirror on GuardianDB's native SQL
layer (upgraded 0.17.2 → 0.18.0) plus a fleet-aware fallback in
`gitops_projects`, closing the visibility gap. Separately root-caused the
actual cross-node read failures to a missing `fetch_from_host`
discovery-fallback and missing `gossip::dispatch` routes for the billing
endpoints — fixed both; billing now converges byte-identical fleet-wide.

Implements the requested per-node relay + guardian-db anti-entropy
architecture: every node embeds and gossips its own relay, a relay-selection
algorithm replaces stale connect hints, and a 60s anti-entropy loop detects
and reconciles guardian-db divergence between random peers — live-verified
converging a real fleet divergence.

Found and fixed a live plaintext-secret leak (a real GitHub PAT served
unmasked via project settings) with a credential-shape auto-detector, and
cleaned up 3 abandoned duplicate Simpfi projects.

## a29c4f1 — Docs + a one-time fleet-wide sweep for existing leaked secrets

Ran the new credential-shape detector as a one-time backfill across every
project on every live node (not just future writes) and found two more real,
already-exposed OpenAI API keys (`fatni`, `shoomoo`) beyond the original
GitHub PAT — resealed all of them; a follow-up re-scan confirmed zero
credential-shaped values remain stored as non-sensitive fleet-wide.

## c2bbfce — Add caching + a read-only PostgreSQL/tables view to the admin Data Browser

The Data Browser's collection/row/table reads are now client-cached for 15s
(mutations still bust the cache immediately, unchanged). Adds a Documents |
Tables (PostgreSQL) view toggle backed by the relational layer above: two
new admin endpoints (`GET /v1/admin/sql/tables`, `POST /v1/admin/sql/query`)
enforced SELECT-only server-side, live-verified end-to-end through the real
dashboard including the guardrail actually being exercised via the UI's own
query box. Along the way, confirmed the dashboard's `/ops` proxy forwards to
the current control-plane leader regardless of which node runs the
dashboard process — a new admin endpoint needs the leader deployed first.

## 41459ad — Fix stale launchd labels in shadw-watchdog.sh

The KeepAlive-backstop watchdog (`dev.shadw.watchdog`) still targeted the
pre-rename labels `dev.shadw.node-a`/`dev.shadw.node-b`, so every 30s tick
silently no-op'd after the local nodes were renamed to
`dev.shadw.fc-lax`/`dev.shadw.fc-lax2` — letting fc-lax2 sit crashed (a
third-party `noq`/`noq-proto` panic-in-destructor abort) for 9h13m despite
launchd `KeepAlive=true`. Updated the watchdog's targets to the current
labels; verified live.

## 166ea99 — Fix stale fleet dashboard + a stale va binary; add scripts/deploy-ui-fleet.sh

The Data Browser's Tables (PostgreSQL) view (c2bbfce) was invisible on the
real https://shadw.cloud because that rollout updated only the backend
binary, never the ui/ dashboard (systemd `hive-ui.service`) — every public
node kept serving a pre-feature build. Separately, va was serving a stale
`hive-cloud` binary that predated the SQL routes entirely (a prior rebuild
was never swapped into its live path). Rebuilt+restarted the dashboard on
all 6 public nodes and swapped in va's correct binary; live-verified via
the compiled bundle, the backend routes, and a real browser hit against
shadw.cloud. Adds `scripts/deploy-ui-fleet.sh` so this doesn't regress
silently again.
