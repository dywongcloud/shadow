## (pending) — Fix admin incidents page; generic leader→follower store replication for the whole node-local divergence class

The admin incidents page didn't load and "create didn't work": `IncidentStore`
was node-local, so incidents created on the control-plane leader (where every
mutation forwards) were invisible to reads that the dashboard's multi-A DNS
landed on any other node. A fleet audit found this was a whole CLASS —
~12 stores (apikeys, webhooks, databases, domains, integrations, gitops, docs,
notifications, identity, enterprise, teams, incidents) took mutations only on
the leader but served reads from the local store. Rather than hand-write a
gossip arm + adoption block per store, added one generic mechanism
(`store_sync::REGISTRY` + a `/v1/store-snapshot/<name>` gossip arm + a follower
loop that adopts each store's snapshot when it changes). Serialization is
canonicalized through `serde_json::Value` (sorted keys) so the byte-compare
change-gate is stable even for HashMap-backed stores with nested maps — a first
cut re-adopted databases/domains/gitops every tick until that landed.
`apikeys` was the severest case: a key minted on the leader now verifies on
every node instead of failing API auth on followers. Audit replication was
live-verified adopting 659 entries onto a follower. Also added
`DELETE /v1/incidents/:id` (was resolve-only). Secret-bearing stores ride the
existing peer-trust-enforced signed mesh.

Edge-enforcement config (WAF rules, redirects/rewrites, bot policy) replicates
too, so every node enforces the leader's config. Cron is the exception — its
jobs are split across nodes (manual jobs on the leader, `vercel.json` jobs on
the building node), so `cron_list` fans out read-only and merges instead
(execution stays per-node, never double-firing).

`securelinks`/`audit` gained `snapshot()`/`load()`; `Team`/`Member`/`Incident`
gained `PartialEq`; `vendor/guardian-db` is now a workspace-excluded path dep so
its own test suite runs standalone.

## (pending) — fc-sanjose-2 bring-up; fix workflows-page 400, teams-mirror corruption, and guardian-db index flakiness

Brought up the fleet's 10th node, fc-sanjose-2 (43.173.78.95): PVM kernel
built from `virt-pvm/linux@pvm-612` (the ansible `pvm_firecracker` role now
clones that base and applies the fsgsbase/rdtscp fallback patches only on
hosts that need them — the patch repo's own `kernel/` dir is a non-buildable
browsing tree), firecracker-next, podman+gVisor, backend, dashboard, embedded
+ standalone relay, guardian replication, and a hardened lockdown (9090
blocked publicly). `hive-lockdown.sh` is now git-tracked and deployed by the
`prerequisites` role, which also disables+masks `firewalld` — a fresh Rocky
10 image ships it active and its restrictive default zone silently blocked
the relay/discovery ports underneath the hive rules. The PVM role gained a
`pvm_already_provisioned` idempotency gate (a re-run on an already-PVM host
used to self-referentially re-configure from the PVM kernel's own config and
break the build).

`GET /v1/workflows/runs?summary=1` returned 400 (the dashboard workflows page
couldn't load runs): axum's `Query` bool deserialization only accepts literal
`true`/`false`. All 7 `Option<bool>` query fields in `admin.rs` now use a
lenient deserializer accepting `1`/`0` (matching the mesh-RPC path's existing
convention); swept every crate — the class is confined to `admin.rs`.

The relational teams mirror lost 3 of 5 real teams fleet-wide: the TeamStore
itself diverges across nodes (mutations land only on the control-plane
leader; followers never merged them), so a brief failover put a stale
stand-in in charge of `sync_teams`, whose delete-reconciliation wiped every
team it had never heard of. Followers now adopt the leader's TeamStore each
mirror tick via a new `/v1/teams/snapshot` mesh arm, and the delete phase is
tombstone-guarded (`updated_ms` staleness) so a live leader's rows can't be
wiped. Separately, guardian-db's document-store index rebuild dropped rows
whose content-blob fetch transiently failed (table counts flickered to 0 on
healthy nodes) — it now falls back to the previously-fetched value. Every
guardian SQL op is also bounded by a 10s timeout (a corrupted first-open used
to hang reads forever with zero signal).

## 88fe215 — Fix multi-tenancy data-visibility/usage-consistency bugs; add relational layer on guardian-db 0.18; add per-node relay + guardian-db anti-entropy

Team Simpfi's `drugs-wtf` project and fleet-wide billing/metrics were reported
missing/inconsistent — `ProjectStore`/`BillingStore` were node-local-only with
no gossip replication. Adds a relational mirror on GuardianDB's native SQL
layer (upgraded 0.17.2 → 0.18.0) plus a fleet-aware fallback in
`gitops_projects`, closing the visibility gap. Separately root-caused the
actual cross-node read failures to a missing `fetch_from_host`
discovery-fallback and missing `gossip::dispatch` routes for the billing
endpoints — fixed both; billing now converges byte-identical fleet-wide.

Implements the requested per-node relay + guardian-db anti-entropy
architecture: every node embeds and gossips its own relay, a relay-selection
algorithm replaces stale connect hints, and a 60s anti-entropy loop detects
and reconciles guardian-db divergence between random peers — live-verified
converging a real fleet divergence.

Found and fixed a live plaintext-secret leak (a real GitHub PAT served
unmasked via project settings) with a credential-shape auto-detector, and
cleaned up 3 abandoned duplicate Simpfi projects.

## a29c4f1 — Docs + a one-time fleet-wide sweep for existing leaked secrets

Ran the new credential-shape detector as a one-time backfill across every
project on every live node (not just future writes) and found two more real,
already-exposed OpenAI API keys (`fatni`, `shoomoo`) beyond the original
GitHub PAT — resealed all of them; a follow-up re-scan confirmed zero
credential-shaped values remain stored as non-sensitive fleet-wide.

## c2bbfce — Add caching + a read-only PostgreSQL/tables view to the admin Data Browser

The Data Browser's collection/row/table reads are now client-cached for 15s
(mutations still bust the cache immediately, unchanged). Adds a Documents |
Tables (PostgreSQL) view toggle backed by the relational layer above: two
new admin endpoints (`GET /v1/admin/sql/tables`, `POST /v1/admin/sql/query`)
enforced SELECT-only server-side, live-verified end-to-end through the real
dashboard including the guardrail actually being exercised via the UI's own
query box. Along the way, confirmed the dashboard's `/ops` proxy forwards to
the current control-plane leader regardless of which node runs the
dashboard process — a new admin endpoint needs the leader deployed first.

## 41459ad — Fix stale launchd labels in shadw-watchdog.sh

The KeepAlive-backstop watchdog (`dev.shadw.watchdog`) still targeted the
pre-rename labels `dev.shadw.node-a`/`dev.shadw.node-b`, so every 30s tick
silently no-op'd after the local nodes were renamed to
`dev.shadw.fc-lax`/`dev.shadw.fc-lax2` — letting fc-lax2 sit crashed (a
third-party `noq`/`noq-proto` panic-in-destructor abort) for 9h13m despite
launchd `KeepAlive=true`. Updated the watchdog's targets to the current
labels; verified live.

## 166ea99 — Fix stale fleet dashboard + a stale va binary; add scripts/deploy-ui-fleet.sh

The Data Browser's Tables (PostgreSQL) view (c2bbfce) was invisible on the
real https://shadw.cloud because that rollout updated only the backend
binary, never the ui/ dashboard (systemd `hive-ui.service`) — every public
node kept serving a pre-feature build. Separately, va was serving a stale
`hive-cloud` binary that predated the SQL routes entirely (a prior rebuild
was never swapped into its live path). Rebuilt+restarted the dashboard on
all 6 public nodes and swapped in va's correct binary; live-verified via
the compiled bundle, the backend routes, and a real browser hit against
shadw.cloud. Adds `scripts/deploy-ui-fleet.sh` so this doesn't regress
silently again.

## f6c9798 — Add teams/team_members/deployments to the admin SQL view + full billing backfill

The SQL (PostgreSQL) view was missing whole surfaces: no teams, users
(team_members), or deployments tables, and `billing_accounts` only held
tenants actively metered on a tick (4 rows while 20+ tenants existed).
Adds three view-only tables plus `spawn_relational_mirror_loop` — teams,
members, and a FULL billing snapshot backfill sync from the control-plane
leader, own-deployments from every node, content-hash-debounced so quiet
ticks write nothing. Fleet-rolled and live-verified: billing_accounts
4 → 23 rows, real teams/members/deployment rows replicated cross-node,
existing tables and the SELECT-only guard unchanged.

## a2af203 — Watchdog: persistent KeepAlive loop; launchd pended-spawn root cause

fc-lax2 crashed again (same upstream `noq` abort) and sat down because the
watchdog LaunchAgent had never fired: launchd on this long-uptime gui domain
reports `pended nondemand spawn = speculative` and indefinitely defers
StartInterval/RunAtLoad spawns — only demand spawns (`kickstart`) run.
Converted the watchdog to a persistent self-looping KeepAlive daemon
(`WATCHDOG_LOOP=1`), re-bootstrapped, and adversarially verified: SIGABRT'd
fc-lax2 and watched the watchdog restore it autonomously in under a minute.
Separately, fc-virginia and fc-virginia-2 are userspace-frozen (ICMP alive,
all service ports dead from every vantage incl. VPC-internal) and need a
Tencent-console reboot — out of reach from this session.
