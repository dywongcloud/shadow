//! GuardianDB backend — **always on**, in local/dev and production alike.
//!
//! [guardian-db] is an iroh-native, content-addressed store (iroh-docs +
//! iroh-blobs, BLAKE3, QUIC). Every platform snapshot is written into a real
//! GuardianDB key/value store: persisted on disk under `$HIVE_DATA/guardian` and
//! replicated across the iroh mesh via Willow range-based reconciliation. This is
//! NOT a mock — it is the durable, peer-replicated copy of platform state.
//!
//! The local file snapshot ([`crate::persist`]) remains the bootstrap source of
//! truth for fast cold start; GuardianDB adds durability + replication on top.
//! Init and writes are best-effort: any failure is logged and never breaks the
//! request path or the on-disk snapshot, so a node always boots and serves.
//!
//! State is partitioned by **tenant namespace** ([`crate::persist::namespaced`])
//! and each namespace is stored under its own key (`ns/<namespace>/state`), so
//! every org/team's projects, deployments and databases stay scoped and isolated
//! in the replicated store — never commingled in one global blob.
//!
